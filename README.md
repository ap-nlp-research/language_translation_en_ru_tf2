# Language Translation (EN-RU) Project

The goal of the project to demonstrate the performance difference between various sequence 2 sequence models. The list of the models includes: Embedded GRU, Embedded Bidirectional GRO, and Multiplicative Attention models.

### Installation

The project assumes exection of the code in Python3.6 and Tensorflow 2.0. For convenience the project was designed to run on Colab (GPU) instance. For more details, please see [MachineTranslationModels.ipynb](./MachineTranslationModels.ipynb)
